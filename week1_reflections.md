**Week One Reflection**

Throughout my first week of learning Python, I have learned many topics. We covered various topics, including what a computer is, what programming is, why learning Python is important, and more. From there, I learned about compilers, tokens, expressions, statements, variables (and how to name them), strings, escape sequences, debugging, binary, input, output, files, and more smaller things. I also learned how to apply these things to code using Google Colab. Some codes that I have made are below as a show of progress.
